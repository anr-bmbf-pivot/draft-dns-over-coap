[Dnsdir Telechat review of -17 by Vladimír Čunát][review-ietf-core-dns-over-coap-17-dnsdir-telechat-cunat-2025-07-31]
=================================================

[[VC-Review-1][review-ietf-core-dns-over-coap-17-dnsdir-telechat-cunat-2025-07-31]] dnsdir assigned me reviewing this draft.  I found no issues in there, except a
nit below.

[[VC-Review-2][review-ietf-core-dns-over-coap-17-dnsdir-telechat-cunat-2025-07-31]] Note that my knowledge around constrained systems (including CoAP) is close to
zero, so I could easily miss issues in those aspects.  I've read through this
whole document and glanced at some related constrained stuff.

[[VC-Review-3][review-ietf-core-dns-over-coap-17-dnsdir-telechat-cunat-2025-07-31]] Aside: I'd think that DNS people in IETF mostly won't be thrilled to have yet
another transport for DNS, but I understand that the current DNS encryption
options aren't great for such very constrained use cases, and I don't expect
DoC to become common outside of those cases.

[[VC-Review-4][review-ietf-core-dns-over-coap-17-dnsdir-telechat-cunat-2025-07-31]] Nit: some examples use `ARCOUNT` and some don't.  I'd suggest to unify all to
`ADDITIONAL`.
